            <strong>Brasília, September 24, 2024</strong> – Former President Jair Bolsonaro announced a new bill aimed at public safety today during an event in Brasília. The proposal, which promises to increase investment in technology and resources for police forces, was presented as a response to growing concerns about crime in the country.

            In his speech, Bolsonaro highlighted the importance of strengthening security to ensure the protection of citizens. "We need more effective policies and resources that really work to combat crime. This bill is an important step towards restoring peace of mind to the Brazilian people," he said.
            
            The bill includes measures such as the creation of a support fund for state police forces, incentives for the use of monitoring technologies and a training program for security agents. The former president also criticized the current administration, stating that "public safety lacks priority and investment."
            
            The event attracted a large number of supporters, who expressed enthusiasm for the proposals. The initiative also aims to mobilize Bolsonaro's electoral base, who continues to be an influential figure in Brazilian politics.
            
            Political analysts point out that this strategy could reinforce his image as a defender of security, especially with the municipal elections approaching. The proposal will be presented to Congress in the coming days, and Bolsonaro hopes to count on the support of allies for its approval.
